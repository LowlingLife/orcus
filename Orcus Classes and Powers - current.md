# Character Elements

Making a first-level character involves choosing a few key elements:

* A race.
* A class.
* A kit, if you play with them, or a feat, if not.
* Some trained skills.
* Some powers. 
* Setting their six ability scores. 

Of these, the choice of class is probably most consequential. 

As a character increases in level, they will make other choices, picking up other feats and powers, and - at certain levels - a prestige path and an epic path as well. 

# Classes

Every character belongs to a class, which they choose at first level. They will remain a member of this class during their entire adventuring career - perhaps up to level 30, the highest level available. 

Since there are ways to get some of the perks of other classes, such as multiclass feats and kits, the original class you chose is sometimes referred to as your "base class". If you do pick up other classes, you count as a member of those classes, but they will never affect your character as much as your base class does. 

## Traditions and Roles

Each class has one or more traditions, which summarize where that class draws most of its power from. 

* **Arcane:** The practitioners of the arcane tradition seek to understand the unexplainable, categorize the bizarre, and otherwise access the ephemeral in a systematic way. If your power comes from arcane magic, it is studied or learned. A bard studies songs that have magical effects; a warlock bargains for or steals magical knowledge from powerful extraplanar beings; and a wizard researches and memorizes magical spells. 
* **Natural:** An instinctual connection to  and faith in the world, the cycle of day and night, the turning of the  seasons, and the natural selection of predator and prey drive the natural tradition. If your power comes from the natural tradition, it is drawn from the natural world or the spirits of the world. A barbarian is ridden by the spirits for their own purposes; a druid serves the spirits and is empowered by them as a reward. A shaman consults and calls friendly spirits. 
* **Martial:** Your power comes from strength at arms, experience in battle and training. Martial adventurers have extraordinary abilities, but they are grounded in what is humanly possible. 
* **Divine:** The power of the divine is steeped in faith, the unseen, and belief in a power source from beyond the Material Plane. If your power comes from divine magic, it is granted by the gods or other higher powers. A cleric is or was part of the organized hierarchy of a religion; a speaker has been directly chosen by a god. Paladins serve the gods directly or a cause that a god favors. 
* **Shadow:** Your power comes from dark magic, the occult or other mysteries.  

Each class has one or two roles, which summarize how the class most often contributes in combat.

* **Defender:** A defender soaks up attacks and damage from enemies, punishes enemies for attacking their allies *and* punishes enemies for attacking the defender. The defender forces enemies to make difficult decisions or puts them in a "catch-22".
* **Striker:** A striker does the most damage or otherwise puts enemies out of action, particularly if they are supported by their allies - but they can be vulnerable if they are left exposed. 
* **Leader:** A leader helps their allies do their jobs better in combat, by keeping them alive through healing and defensive bonuses, by increasing their damage output or other contributions, and by enabling them to do things that they couldn't do before (even if that is as simple as helping them get into position for an attack).
* **Controller:** A controller gives the team control over the battlefield, with crowd control attacks, area denial or impeded movement that limits where and how enemies can move, and negative conditions that reduce what the enemies can do or how effectively they do it.  

## Powers

Classes follow the default power progression, shown below, unless otherwise mentioned.

The numbers indicate powers from your class (although note that sometimes you will have the opportunity to select a power not of your class, but filling a class slot). 

"P" indicates a power from your prestige path, so for example at level 11 you will typically gain an encounter attack power from your prestige path. "E" indicates a power from your epic path. 

The appendix has a table that shows which level powers a character of a particular level (following the default progression) can have. This is useful if you are creating a character at higher than 1st level, or if you get confused about which powers can be replaced when. 

When you reach a level that allows you to replace a power, you choose a class attack power you know of that frequency (encounter or daily) and give it up, exchanging it for a power of the level you're gaining. For example, at level 13 you can give up one of your existing encounter attack powers (e.g., the one you got at level 1) in exchange for a level 13 encounter attack power.

# Kits

Kits are another way of customizing your character at first level, if permitted by the Game Master (see "Playing with Kits", below). They represent another facet to your character that isn't captured by their race or their class. 

You can retrain a kit using your one permitted retrain per level. 

Kits will typically give features a few times during the adventurer tier, usually starting with a feature or two at level 1. 

### Playing with Kits

Game Masters can approach kits in a few different ways:

1. Each character gets a kit at first level. 
2. No character gets a kit. 
3. Characters can choose a kit, but they have to give up some of their feats to do so. 

If you play with the third option, characters must give up three of their adventurer-tier feats (levels 1, 4 and 10) in order to access one kit's features, or all six of their adventurer-tier feats (levels 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10) to access one kit's features and the discipline associated with that kit. Of course, you can always allow player characters to pick up a kit at a later time, as long as they give up the same number of feats. 

### About Kits

Kits are usually named starting with a verb, like "Dabbles in Wizardry", "Takes Vermin Form", "Binds Familiar" or "Manifests Mindblade".

"Dabbles in ..." kits are ways to multiclass. "Worships the ..." kits are for worshippers of different gods (what might be called domains). "Specializes in ..." kits are for those who specialize in a particular school of arcane magic.

**Mageblade Skills (Level 5):** You become trained in a skill of your choice from the Mageblade class skills.

* When you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you gain momentum. When you are hit by any kind of attack, you lose momentum. Momentum has no effect on its own, but it is required for your Triumphant Strike feature and is referenced by some powers.

## Binds Familiar

You have bound to your service a familiar, a Tiny animal or creature that aids you and provides companionship. 

**Spirit Friend (Level 1):** You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose (from the list below).

The familiar obeys the following rules:

*Actions*

* If you take a move action, the familiar can take a move action as well.
* You can give up actions to command the familiar, in which case it gets to take the same actions. For example, you can give up your standard action in order for the familiar to take a standard action. 

*Stats and Combat*

* All familiars have 1 hit point, but they are never damaged on a miss. Your own attacks never target your familiar, even if they normally target "all creatures". 
* When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after your next extended rest. 
* Your familiar uses your Armor Class, Fortitude, Reflex and Will defenses. 
* Your familiar cannot contribute to a flank. 

*Hidden Away/Called*

* As a swift action, your familiar can hide away on your person, which may involve disappearing in a puff of smoke until you call them again, or turning into a tattoo on your arm or a statuette in your pocket, or simply slipping into your pocket. While hidden away, it provides you with no benefits, but it also cannot be targeted by any effect, does not take damage, etc. 
* You can call a hidden away familiar as a swift action. It appears in a square adjacent to you.

# Disciplines

A discipline is a set of powers that are thematically related. Characters get access to disciplines from their classes, and sometimes from other sources. Having access to a discipline just means you can choose powers from that discipline when you get to select class powers; it does not give you immediate access to those powers. 

### Key and Secondary Abilities

Some classes specify that powers selected from class disciplines use different abilities to those specified. If you gain access to the powers of a discipline from another source, this rule does not apply. 

*For example, Arty is a Goading Swashbuckler, which lets him replace a power's secondary ability with Charisma. He selects the power* deadly thrust *from Blades in the Dark, which identifies Strength as its secondary ability. He uses Charisma in place of Strength when using that ability.*

*Porthy is a Fighter with the kit "Dabbles in Swashbuckling", which gives him access to the Blades in the Dark discipline. However, since his access to the discipline comes from his kit, not his class, he cannot use Charisma in place of Strength when using Blades in the Dark powers.*

## Elemental Flux

When you first gain a power with the Flux tag, choose an element: lightning, acid, cold, fire or thunder. All powers with the Flux keyword have that energy as a keyword, and replace any reference to [flux] in the power text with that energy. There are some powers that allow you to change your flux energy, if you take them. You can also change your flux energy when you retrain at a new level. Some classes interact with Flux powers in other ways. 

When a power refers to [flux], it always means your current flux energy, even if you used the power when your flux energy was different. For example, if you conjured a vortex devil, it does damage of your current flux energy not the flux energy you had when you conjured it.

# Prestige Paths

At level 11, each player character gets a prestige path. This path is in addition to their main class, which still gives them some powers. 

## Weapon Master

**_Requirements:_** One or more of your powers has the Martial tag

### Class Features

***Quick Change Artist (11th level):*** As a swift action, you can sheathe a weapon and draw a weapon.

**_Whirling Dervish (11th level):_** Instead of spending an action point to take an additional action, you can spend it to use two at-will attack powers that require a standard action, one after the other. They do not have to have the same target.

**_Careful Opportunist (16th level):_** When a creature provokes an opportunity attack, you can use an at-will attack power instead of making a basic attack. You must make a melee attack.

### Powers

#### One-Two Punch

**Encounter** **Standard Action**
**Weapon Master Attack 11** ● **Martial, Weapon**
**Melee or Ranged** weapon, one target 
**Attack:** Strength vs AC, two attacks
**Hit:** 2dW + Strength modifier damage and the target is dazed until the end of their next turn. If both attacks hit, the target is stunned until the end of their next turn.  

#### Fast Learner

**Daily** **Swift Action**
**Weapon Master Utility 12** ● **Martial**
**Self** 
**Effect:** Select a feat you meet the prerequisites for. You gain that feat until your next long rest.

#### First Blood

**Daily** **Standard Action**
**Weapon Master Attack 20** ● **Martial, Weapon**
**Near** burst 1, all enemies 
**Attack:** Strength vs AC
**Hit:** 3dW + Strength modifier damage if the target is below maximum HP.
5dW + Strength modifier damage if the target is at maximum HP.
**Miss:** Half damage.

## Prince of Shadows

**_Requirements:_** Your base class has the Striker role.

You are recognized by every brigand and cutpurse, every sneakthief and bandit. Cat burglars are your courtiers; extortionists your earls. The darkness is your cloak and crown.

### Class Features

***Trusty Action (11th level):*** You perform … not quite reliably, but always with spectacular results.

When you use an action point to take an extra action, the action always succeeds (you pass your skill check or at least one attack roll in an attack no matter your roll, for example). If you would fail, you succeed but there’s a side-effect or "sting in the tail" - like a tremendous success drawing unwanted attention or a desperate lunge slaying your enemy but leaving you open to their allies. 

**_Do As I Do (11th level):_** You are used to leading teams along corridors on tip-toes or up walls without rope or crampon. No one can afford to fail.

When you make a skill check, allies gain a +2 power bonus to the same skill until the beginning of your next turn. 

**_The Cloak is My Shadow, I Shall Not Want (16th level):_** Your cloak billows as you move, hiding you away until it seems to be all cloak and no man.

You do not grant combat advantage from being flanked. 

### Powers

#### Just Desserts

**Encounter** **Immediate (React) Action**
**Prince of Shadows Attack 11** ● **Shadow, Weapon**
**Melee or Ranged** weapon, one target
**Trigger:** The target imposes a condition or persistent damage on you or an ally. 
**Attack:** Dexterity vs AC
**Hit:** 2dW + Dexterity modifier and the target suffers the condition or persistent damage that they imposed. 

#### Out of Mind

**Daily Minor Action**
**Prince of Shadows Utility 16** ● **Shadow, Teleport**
**Self** 
**Effect:** You teleport 20, but must choose a square that no other creature can see (you need not be able to see it). You are incorporeal and have phasing until the end of your next turn. 

#### Cloak Abduction

**Daily** **Standard Action**
**Prince of Shadows Attack 20** ● **Shadow**
**Near** burst 1, one target 
**Attack:** Dexterity vs AC
**Hit:** The creature is transported to an extradimensional space and cannot act (save ends). On a successful save, it appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to you. 
*Optional:* The creature takes 2dW + Dexterity modifier damage at the start of each turn it spends in the extradimensional space.
**Miss:** The creature is transported to the extradimensional space only till the end of its next turn, and it takes no damage. 

# Epic Paths

At level 21, each player character gets an epic path. This path is on top of their main class, which still gives them some powers, and their prestige path (which stops giving them powers after level 20). 

## Agent Retriever

Elemental tyrants, the heralds of the gods, the voices between the planets - they all have peculiar needs, and the agents retriever cater to them. You travel across the planes, locating and acquiring whatever your patrons need. 

***Requirements:*** You must have retrieved something of value from another plane of existence, and traded it for a fair price. 

### Immortality

When your adventuring days come to an end, a number of different fates may await you. What follows is one possibility. 

***Corner of the World's Eye:*** You fade away from public view, but no one can ever confirm your death. Just when people think old age, misadventure or vengeance must have done you in, someone reports spying you in a bazaar, or finding your calling card in the Celestial Vaults, or seeing you for a moment through a pool in the Astral Plane. 

### Class Features

***Appropriation (Level 21):*** Each night, you dream of a magic item. After a long rest, choose any magic item of your level or lower. That magic item appears under your bedroll, ready for use. It disappears when you begin your next long rest. 

The magic item is not created, it is summoned. The GM may want to identify which creature's possession the magic item was summoned from, and whether there are any hints to your identity when it arrives back in their possession the following day. 

***Interplanar Contingencies (Level 24):*** Once per day, when you die, you appear the following round on your initiative count with half your maximum HP and under the slowed condition, in an unoccupied space of your choice at least 6 squares from your dead body. You cannot use any attack powers or recoveries, but you have all the equipment and magic items that were on your person when you died. The equipment and magic items that are actually on your body become shimmering and insubstantial, and cannot be used or picked up.  

When you are adjacent to your corpse, you can use a swift action to merge the old and new bodies. You can now use attack powers and recoveries, although you do not recover any powers or recoveries that were already spent. You lose the slowed condition, but otherwise keep the HP and any conditions, persistent damage, etc., of your new body. Choose which square your merged body appears in. 

***The Economic Flow (Level 30):*** You are at the center of a vast trade network. If something is for sale anywhere in the planes, for any price, you can purchase it with a snap of your fingers (free action). The object appears in your hand or on your person, if feasible, or otherwise in the nearest unoccupied space(s) that can hold it. The payment price must be on your person (for example, a pouch of gold pieces on your belt) - it disappears at the same time as the purchased object appears.
