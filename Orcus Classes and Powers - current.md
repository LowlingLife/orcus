# Orcus Classes and Powers

A retroclone of 4th Edition

Version 0.1 (Alpha)



Dedicated to the hobbyists, designers, developers and publishers that have released their work under the Open Game License.

Orcus is a work in progress. All feedback is welcome. 

# Character Elements

Making a first-level character involves choosing a few key elements:

* A race.
* A class.
* A kit, if you play with them, or a feat, if not.
* Some trained skills.
* Some powers. 
* Setting their six ability scores. 

Of these, the choice of class is probably most consequential. 

As a character increases in level, they will make other choices, picking up other feats and powers, and - at certain levels - a prestige path and an epic path as well. 

# Classes

Every character belongs to a class, which they choose at first level. They will remain a member of this class during their entire adventuring career - perhaps up to level 30, the highest level available. 

Since there are ways to get some of the perks of other classes, such as multiclass feats and kits, the original class you chose is sometimes referred to as your "base class". If you do pick up other classes, you count as a member of those classes, but they will never affect your character as much as your base class does. 

## Powers

Classes follow the default power progression, shown below, unless otherwise mentioned.

The numbers indicate powers from your class (although note that sometimes you will have the opportunity to select a power not of your class, but filling a class slot). 

"P" indicates a power from your prestige path, so for example at level 11 you will typically gain an encounter attack power from your prestige path. "E" indicates a power from your epic path. 

The appendix has a table that shows which level powers a character of a particular level (following the default progression) can have. This is useful if you are creating a character at higher than 1st level, or if you get confused about which powers can be replaced when. 

When you reach a level that allows you to replace a power, you choose a class attack power you know of that frequency (encounter or daily) and give it up, exchanging it for a power of the level you're gaining. For example, at level 13 you can give up one of your existing encounter attack powers (e.g., the one you got at level 1) in exchange for a level 13 encounter attack power.

## Swashbuckler

Martial Striker
**Group:** Rogue

**Recoveries per Long Rest:** 6 + your Constitution modifier.
**Defenses:** +2 Reflex.

### Proficiencies and Training

**Trained Skills:** You are trained in 4 skills from your class skills.
**Class Skills:** Acrobatics, Athletics, Bluff, Diplomacy, Insight, Intimidate, Perception, Stealth, Streetsmarts, Sleight of Hand.

### Features

#### Gain Momentum

When you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you gain momentum. When you are hit by any kind of attack, you lose momentum.

#### Triumphant Strike

While you have momentum, once per turn you can add +1d6 damage to any kind of attack. *Level 11:* +2d6 damage. *Level 21:* +3d6 damage.

#### Bide Your Time

If you use an encounter attack power and do not hit any targets, you can lose your momentum to keep the encounter power (it is not expended). You can only use this feature if you have momentum.

#### Nick of Time

You get a +2 bonus on attack rolls you make outside of your turn (e.g. opportunity attacks and immediate actions).

### Subclasses

Choose either Forceful Swashbuckler or Goading Swashbuckler. 

* **Forceful Swashbuckler:** Your secondary ability is Strength. Once per turn, when you shift, you can pull an adjacent enemy 1 at one point during your movement. 
* **Goading Swashbuckler:** Your secondary ability is Charisma. Your triumphant strike does additional damage equal to your Strength modifier when you attack a marked enemy. 

### Powers

You can choose powers from your class disciplines. When you do so, you can replace any reference to the discipline's key ability with Dexterity instead. You can replace any reference to the discipline's secondary ability or abilities with the secondary ability linked to your subclass.

**Class Disciplines:** Rapier's Point, Blades in the Dark.

### Dualclass

If a character takes the Dualclass Recruit feat and selects the Swashbuckler, it has the following benefit:

**Benefit:** You belong to the Rogue group and the Swashbuckler class (along with any other groups and classes that you belong to), and gain the following benefits:

* When you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you gain momentum. When you are hit by any kind of attack, you lose momentum. Momentum has no effect on its own, but it is required for your Triumphant Strike feature and is referenced by some powers.

* Once per encounter, you can use the Swashbuckler's Triumphant Strike feature (noting that it requires momentum to use).

# Kits

Kits are another way of customizing your character at first level, if permitted by the Game Master (see "Playing with Kits", below). They represent another facet to your character that isn't captured by their race or their class. 

You can retrain a kit using your one permitted retrain per level. 

Kits will typically give features a few times during the adventurer tier, usually starting with a feature or two at level 1. 

### Playing with Kits

Game Masters can approach kits in a few different ways:

1. Each character gets a kit at first level. 
2. No character gets a kit. 
3. Characters can choose a kit, but they have to give up some of their feats to do so. 

If you play with the third option, characters must give up three of their adventurer-tier feats (levels 1, 4 and 10) in order to access one kit's features, or all six of their adventurer-tier feats (levels 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10) to access one kit's features and the discipline associated with that kit. Of course, you can always allow player characters to pick up a kit at a later time, as long as they give up the same number of feats. 

### About Kits

Kits are usually named starting with a verb, like "Dabbles in Wizardry", "Takes Vermin Form", "Binds Familiar" or "Manifests Mindblade".

"Dabbles in ..." kits are ways to multiclass. "Worships the ..." kits are for worshippers of different gods (what might be called domains). "Specializes in ..." kits are for those who specialize in a particular school of arcane magic. 

## Dabbles in Swashbuckling 

Swashbuckler multiclass.

**Requirements:** You cannot take this kit if you belong to any class in the Rogue group (e.g. Swashbuckler).

**Buckle Your Swashes (Level 1):** You belong to the Rogue group and the Swashbuckler class (along with any other groups and classes that you belong to), and gain the following benefits:

* When you hit an enemy with a melee attack, you gain momentum. When you are hit by any kind of attack, you lose momentum. Momentum has no effect on its own, but it is required for your Triumphant Strike feature and is referenced by some powers.

* Once per encounter, you can use the Swashbuckler's Triumphant Strike feature (noting that it requires momentum to use).

**Swashbuckling Skills (Level 5):** You become trained in a skill of your choice from the Swashbuckler class skills. 

**Bide Your Time (Level 10):** Once per day, you can use the Swashbuckler's Bide Your Time feature. 

**Associated Disciplines (Level 1):** You can take powers from the Rogue list, and from one of the following disciplines: 

* Rapier's Point.
* Blades in the Dark. 

# Disciplines

A discipline is a set of powers that are thematically related. Characters get access to disciplines from their classes, and sometimes from other sources. Having access to a discipline just means you can choose powers from that discipline when you get to select class powers; it does not give you immediate access to those powers. 

### Key and Secondary Abilities

Some classes specify that powers selected from class disciplines use different abilities to those specified. If you gain access to the powers of a discipline from another source, this rule does not apply. 

*For example, Arty is a Goading Swashbuckler, which lets him replace a power's secondary ability with Charisma. He selects the power* deadly thrust *from Blades in the Dark, which identifies Strength as its secondary ability. He uses Charisma in place of Strength when using that ability.*

*Porthy is a Fighter with the kit "Dabbles in Swashbuckling", which gives him access to the Blades in the Dark discipline. However, since his access to the discipline comes from his kit, not his class, he cannot use Charisma in place of Strength when using Blades in the Dark powers.*

## Blades in the Dark

Many of these powers use momentum. Other than these powers, the main way to gain momentum are the features of the Swashbuckler class. You are welcome to take these powers without belonging to the Swashbuckler class, but if they involve momentum they may be of limited use to you. 

If you do gain momentum from a power, the same rule for losing momentum applies as for the Swashbuckler: you lose it if you are hit by any attack.

You are recognized by every brigand and cutpurse, every sneakthief and bandit. Cat burglars are your courtiers; extortionists your earls. The darkness is your cloak and crown.

### Class Features

***Trusty Action (11th level):*** You perform … not quite reliably, but always with spectacular results.

When you use an action point to take an extra action, the action always succeeds (you pass your skill check or at least one attack roll in an attack no matter your roll, for example). If you would fail, you succeed but there’s a side-effect or "sting in the tail" - like a tremendous success drawing unwanted attention or a desperate lunge slaying your enemy but leaving you open to their allies. 

**_Do As I Do (11th level):_** You are used to leading teams along corridors on tip-toes or up walls without rope or crampon. No one can afford to fail.

When you make a skill check, allies gain a +2 power bonus to the same skill until the beginning of your next turn. 

**_The Cloak is My Shadow, I Shall Not Want (16th level):_** Your cloak billows as you move, hiding you away until it seems to be all cloak and no man.

You do not grant combat advantage from being flanked.

# Epic Paths

At level 21, each player character gets an epic path. This path is on top of their main class, which still gives them some powers, and their prestige path (which stops giving them powers after level 20). 

## Agent Retriever

Elemental tyrants, the heralds of the gods, the voices between the planets - they all have peculiar needs, and the agents retriever cater to them. You travel across the planes, locating and acquiring whatever your patrons need. 

***Requirements:*** You must have retrieved something of value from another plane of existence, and traded it for a fair price. 

### Immortality

When your adventuring days come to an end, a number of different fates may await you. What follows is one possibility. 

***Corner of the World's Eye:*** You fade away from public view, but no one can ever confirm your death. Just when people think old age, misadventure or vengeance must have done you in, someone reports spying you in a bazaar, or finding your calling card in the Celestial Vaults, or seeing you for a moment through a pool in the Astral Plane. 

### Class Features

***Appropriation (Level 21):*** Each night, you dream of a magic item. After a long rest, choose any magic item of your level or lower. That magic item appears under your bedroll, ready for use. It disappears when you begin your next long rest. 

The magic item is not created, it is summoned. The GM may want to identify which creature's possession the magic item was summoned from, and whether there are any hints to your identity when it arrives back in their possession the following day. 

***Interplanar Contingencies (Level 24):*** Once per day, when you die, you appear the following round on your initiative count with half your maximum HP and under the slowed condition, in an unoccupied space of your choice at least 6 squares from your dead body. You cannot use any attack powers or recoveries, but you have all the equipment and magic items that were on your person when you died. The equipment and magic items that are actually on your body become shimmering and insubstantial, and cannot be used or picked up.  

When you are adjacent to your corpse, you can use a swift action to merge the old and new bodies. You can now use attack powers and recoveries, although you do not recover any powers or recoveries that were already spent. You lose the slowed condition, but otherwise keep the HP and any conditions, persistent damage, etc., of your new body. Choose which square your merged body appears in. 

***The Economic Flow (Level 30):*** You are at the center of a vast trade network. If something is for sale anywhere in the planes, for any price, you can purchase it with a snap of your fingers (free action). The object appears in your hand or on your person, if feasible, or otherwise in the nearest unoccupied space(s) that can hold it. The payment price must be on your person (for example, a pouch of gold pieces on your belt) - it disappears at the same time as the purchased object appears.
