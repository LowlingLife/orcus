# Petit 4
The game of unbridled heroic fantasy!

Version 0.2.27

## Introduction

Petit 4 is a medieval-fantasy role-playing game inspired by the fourth edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game, as well as Microlite20 (a minimalist version of the third edition of the world's most popular roleplaying game). 

### Features of Petit 4

- A game designed for heroic, medieval-fantasy settings.	 
- Three abilities, five skills, miscellaneous bonuses and a twenty-sided die at the heart of the game mechanics.	 
- A wide choice of races and classes, from the classic to the exotic.	 
- An power-based combat system based on class, with no miniatures or grid required.	 
- A game compatible with adventures and monsters from Fourth Edition. 

### Why choose Petit 4?	 

- To introduce new players to roleplaying.
- To create player characters in minutes.
- To play with a system that is easy to manage for the Game Master (who never rolls the dice) and dynamic (thanks to Fate points).	 
- To have a complete work in a small number of pages (system, bestiary, setting details!)	
- To reuse official content thanks to an easy conversion process.

## The basics  

To start, each player (except the Game Master) creates their own character.

A character is defined by their three innate abilities (Fortitude, Reflex and Will), two physical and one mental. They are used for attacks and defense. These values can be increased by the race you choose, as well as by increasing in level.

After deciding your abilities, choose your character's class, which represents their profession and role in the group. The class grants equipment, as well as one or more skills, which represent the character's know-how.

Finally, races and classes give the character several powers (special martial or magical abilities).

## Character creation

To create a character, follow the directions below.

### Abilities

Abilities are the main characteristics of your character.

- **Fortitude:** Endurance, strength, or even close combat skills. 
- **Reflex:** Dexterity, speed, accuracy in shooting, etc.

- **Will:** Intelligence, charisma, magical power, etc.

Distribute nine points between abilities, without exceeding +5 in any one ability.

### Hit points

Hit points, or HP, represent physical health, morale, and energy.

Starting hit points = 10 + (Fortitude x 5)

# Character details

## Skills

The skills represent the competencies and know-how of the character.

* **Athletics:** Swimming, jumping, climbing, resisting fatigue, etc.
* **Influence:** Convincing, negotiating, bluffing, lying and detecting lies, etc.
* **Scholarship:** Knowledge of history, mysteries of magic, mythologies, legends, etc.
* **Survival:** Survival in a hostile environment, knowledge of animals and plants, camouflage, etc.
* **Trickery:** Lockpicking, pick-pocketing, reaching underworld contacts, etc.

A character either has a skill or they do not. If they do not have it, they receive a +0 bonus on checks using that skill. If they do have it, they receive a +5 bonus on checks using that skill. 

## Experience
A character gains a level at the end of each adventure. (Note that a long plot can be divided into several adventures.) 

Each level, a character gains +1 to Fortitude, Reflex and Will, and 5 HP.

At 11th level, the character enters the paragon tier. They gain two new class powers and can either increase an ability of their choice by +1 (as well as the normal increase for every new level), gain a new skill, or learn a ritual.

At level 21, a character enters the epic tier. They gain an epic class power and can again increase an ability by +1, gain a new skill or learn a ritual.

## Tiers 

A level corresponds not only to the power of the characters, but also to the difficulty and the scope of their adventures.

At the heroic tier, the PCs can save a village from a goblin attack, explore a small ancient dungeon, and negotiate with a wealthy merchant. The stakes are local.

At the paragon tier, the group can undertake their first planar adventures, passing through the City of Many Windows, or set out in search of a powerful artifact in order to save a kingdom. The stakes are regional.

Finally, at the epic tier, the PCs can challenge the designs of the gods, stop the invasion of the world by an evil race, or destroy the world themselves. The stakes are universal!

# Equipment 

An adventurer has the equipment provided by their class. They cannot use any other. They also have survival gear: rations, rope, torches and so on, as well as tools corresponding to their skills.

If a player wants their character to have an item out of the ordinary, they must either obtain it during the game, or spend a Fate point to justify its presence in their backpack.

* **Improvised weapon:** If a character is deprived of their weapon for some reason, they can still attack unarmed, dealing 1d4 damage.
* **Light weapon:** Dagger, club, etc. 
* **Heavy one-handed weapon:** Sword, mace, battle ax, etc.
* **Heavy two-handed weapon:** Bastard sword, war hammer, halberd, etc.
* **Ranged improvised weapon:** Anyone can throw stones, chairs, or halflings, dealing 1d4 damage.
* **Light ranged weapon:** Short bow, light crossbow, slingshot, throwing knives, etc.
* **Ranged heavy weapon:** Longbow, heavy crossbow, javelins, etc.
* **Shield:** Buckler, rondache, etc.
* **Light armor:** Leather, mesh shirt, scale armor, etc.
* **Heavy armor:** Breastplate, plate armor, harness, etc.

## Wealth

The economy of Petit 4 can be summed up in its four different types of currency, each of which represents a social class.

**Copper,** the only currency that the vast majority of the poor population will ever use. The poor also depend on barter, the case-by-case exchange of objects and services. Wealth in copper means living in a rented or loaned room, owning rudimentary tools, and spending most of your time securing a living.

**Silver** is used by merchants, artisans and heroic adventurers. Wealth in silver means owning a small house, having enough to eat and having complete equipment, even if it may not be in very good condition.

**Gold** is the currency of nobles, merchants and paragon adventurers. With wealth in gold comes a large house, a few servants, abundant provisions, and good quality equipment.

**Platinum** is the preserve of kings, high priests and archmages, and epic adventurers. Platinum wealth could include a castle, land and people in its service, all financed by annuities.

**Diamonds** are a rare currency, even on the Outer Planes. A wealth of diamonds could buy a kingdom or an army on the Material Plane.

## Purchases

The price of each item and service is determined by the Game Master, on a case-by-case basis. There is no precise list. However, we can evaluate an abstract price for each object or service: an object or service is therefore noted as costing copper, silver, gold, platinum or diamond.

A purchase of a wealth tier lower than a character's wealth is done without thinking about it and without consequence. Those of their tier must be rarer and more thoughtful. To buy above your level, you must have found a substantial treasure and be ready to squander it!

Due to their power and rarity, heroic tier magic items have a default value of gold, paragon tier items platinum, and epic tier items diamond. In other words, epic magic items are difficult for even the most powerful player characters to purchase.

# Magic items

Magic items are objects that have acquired supernatural abilities thanks to the ritual *Enchant object*. The tier of the enchanter determines the type of enchantment (heroic, paragon or epic). The *Enchant object* ritual requires a material component that depends on the supernatural ability granted. The component is destroyed during the ritual.

An item can be enchanted a second time by a paragon enchanter (with the same type of enchantment or not), and as many times as desired by an epic enchanter. The material component must come from a different source each time (from another creature, another place and another time).

To learn of and use a magic item's supernatural abilities, a character must attune to it by spending a Fate point to attune to it. This makes the character the item's bearer. Monsters can also attune to magic items, spending Darkness points instead of Fate points. A bearer does not have to be of the same tier as a magic item to use it; a level 1 character can attune to an epic magic item. 

Once a character becomes the bearer of a magic item, this attunement remains indefinitely, unless someone else attunes to the magic item and becomes its new bearer. 

## Heroic enchantments

These enchantments grant the item a consumable ability: once used, the ability is lost. As with any magic item, the bearer must hold the item for the ability to take effect.

*Arcanium* (consumable). Effect: The bearer recharges one of their item powers. Material component: A magic item or a source of arcanium (extremely rare).

*Disappearance* (consumable). Effect: The bearer disappears from the battlefield. They reappear when they want to, in a place of their choice that they are familiar with. Material component: A thief's tooth.

*Healing* (consumable). Effect: The bearer recovers HP equal to their Fortitude (double during a rest). Material component: Water from a holy spring.

*Mana* (consumable). Effect: The bearer recharges one of their unique class powers. Material component: Water from a fairy spring.

*Protection* (consumable). Effect: The bearer receives a +5 bonus to all saving throws until their next rest. Material component: Blood, saliva or hair from a legendary monster.

## Paragon enchantment

This type of enchantment gives a particular object a supernatural property: it works permanently (or under certain conditions) from the moment the bearer controls the magic object.

*Bloody* (weapon property). Effect: The weapon inflicts one extra damage die (two extra if it is enchanted a second time, three extra if enchanted a third time). Material component: The hand of a parricide.

*Ensorcelled* (wand property). Effect: The wand inflicts one extra damage die (two extra if it is enchanted a second time, three extra if enchanted a third time). Material component: A rare arcane grimoire.

*Resistant* (armor or shield property). Effect: The armor or shield provides resistance to damage equal to twice its bonus (x3 if enchanted a second time, x4 the third time). Material component: Dragonscale.

*Sacred* (symbol property). Effect: The symbol inflicts one extra damage die (two extra if it is enchanted a second time, three extra if enchanted a third time). Material component: The miter of a dead prelate.

*Sharp* (weapon property). Effect: The bearer gets a 1d6 bonus to the attack roll each time they attack with the weapon (2d6 if the weapon is enchanted a second time, 3d6 if enchanted a third time). Material component: The hand of a legendary swordsman or archer.

*Sweet death* (weapon property). Effect: The target falls asleep and loses 1d6 HP (continuous effect) (2d6 if the weapon is enchanted a second time, 3d6 the third time). Material component: Fruit of a cursed tree.

## Epic enchantments

Epic enchantments give the item a special power. This power must be activated voluntarily by the bearer for it to take effect. Item powers have - like some class powers - conditions under which they will activate ("Reactions").

These item powers are “unique” and have an entry named Recharge. This specifies what the bearer must do - after the power has been used - so that the power can be activated again. This action cannot be the same one that activated the item.

An item power can never be recharged by the bearer sacrificing Fate points (or the GM sacrificing Darkness points for a monster bearer).

# Game system 	 
The game uses a 20-sided die (d20) to resolve actions and 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12-sided dice to calculate the damage. 

The rules of Petit 4 are intentionally short and relatively abstract. Special cases are managed by the Game Master, because the system is not intended to cover everything. Use your common sense.

## Resolution of actions 
To know if an action is successful or not, roll a d20, add the appropriate ability and a skill bonus (+5) if applicable: 

> d20 + ability + skill	 

If the result is greater than or equal to the Difficulty Class (DC) set by the Game Master, the action succeeds.	 

| Action | DC |
| --- | --- |
| Easy action | 10 |
| Difficult action | 15 |
| Very difficult action | 20 |
| Heroic action | 25 |
| Paragon action | 40 |
| Epic action | 50 |

In the case of an opposing action, the result must be greater than or equal to the value of the opponent's ability. Monsters never roll the dice. Instead, their abilities set the Difficulty Class for the player characters. For example: 

* Fortitude of an orc hero: 19 
* Reflex of a giant spider: 16 
* Will of a deceitful devil: 32

## Critical hits and fumbles

On a natural 1, that is, when the die result is a 1 before any modification, the action backfires, is a critical failure, and the GM earns a Darkness point.

A natural 20 is a critical success, a stunning achievement, and the player earns a Fate point.

## Fate and Darkness Points

At the start of an adventure, each player has a number of Fate points equal to 5 plus half their level (rounded down). The GM has a number of Darkness points equal to half the total number of Fate points of all players. We recommend that you represent these points with brightly colored tokens for Fate points and dark tokens for Darkness points.

For example, in a group of four level 1 characters, each player has 5 Fate points and the GM has 10 Darkness points.

During an action (including an attack roll, a defense roll, a saving throw or a persistence roll), after having rolled the d20, a player can spend a Fate point to transform a critical failure into a regular failure, a failure into success or a success into a critical success (this is called shifting the result up a step). Conversely, the GM can spend a Darkness point to turn a critical success into a regular success, a success into a failure, or a failure into a critical failure. The player and the GM can spend several points successively on the same action.

A critical success or critical failure obtained through the use of Fate or Darkness points does not generate Fate or Darkness points. Only a natural 1 or 20 offers this benefit.

During combat, spending a Fate or Darkness point allows a player character or monster (monster here meaning any creature that is not a player character, such as non-player characters) to recharge a limited power. During a rest, a Fate or Darkness point can be used to recharge a unique power or to recover hit points, as explained in the Combat and Powers chapters.

## Continuous effects

Continuous effects include poison damage, paralysis, or debuffs to attacks and defenses. They affect their target each round, until the dice decide otherwise.

When a player character is the victim of a continuous effect, they can make a saving throw, representing luck and natural resistance, at the end of each of their turns. The player rolls a d20, without applying a modifier. If the result is 10 or more, the save is successful and the continuous effect ends.

When a monster is the victim of a continuous effect, the player responsible for the effect must make a persistence roll, representing the creature's luck and natural resistance, at the end of each of their turns. The player rolls a d20, without applying a modifier. On a 10 or more, the persistence roll succeeds and the continuing effect continues. Otherwise, the effect ends.

Players are responsible for reminding the GM of the existence and details of the continuous effects they cause with their powers. If they forget, the effect is automatically canceled!

## Skill challenges

A skill challenge, as the name suggests, consists of a series of skill checks. The difficulty of these checks is determined by the GM, depending on the nature of the challenge.

If successful, players get a success point. Once the players have three success points, the challenge is complete. In case of failure, players get ... a failure point. (Did you guess?) After three failure points, players lose the challenge.

A critical failure means the situation is worse: not only do players get a failure point, they now take a –2 penalty on all skill checks in the challenge.

A critical success gives two success points.

### Group challenges

Usually, only a few characters participate in a challenge: those with the appropriate skill set. However, a challenge is sometimes imposed on the whole group. Then, each character makes a skill roll. If there are more successes than failures, the players get a success point. If there are fewer successes than failures, they get a failure point.

### Examples of challenges

* **Athletics:** Climb a cliff or swim across a river.
* **Influence:** Convince a noble to give you help.
* **Scholarship:** Solve a riddle or puzzle.
* **Survival:** Cross an inhospitable region without getting lost.
* **Trickery:** Enter an enemy fortress without being spotted.

### Open challenge

An open challenge works just like a challenge, except that the skill to be used is not fixed and the goal to be achieved is less precise than in a normal challenge. It is up to each player to explain which skill they are using and how it helps the group progress towards their goal.

# Combat

Combat is divided into abstract units of time called rounds. Each round represents about six seconds, the time it takes for an exchange of blows. Each round, each player character and monster gets a turn. 

## Course of the fight

To determine the order player characters and monsters act, every player character makes a d20 + Reflex roll to determine their initiative score. The initiative score for each monster is equal to their Reflex value. The Trickery or Survival skills can be applied in dungeon and urban environments or in nature respectively.

The creatures take turns, from the highest to the lowest initiative result. In the event of a tie between one or more player characters and one or more non-player characters, re-roll. This order does not change from round to round.

## Game turn

At the start of a player character or monster's turn, they suffer any continuous effects (such as poison damage) that affect them. Then, they can, in the order of their choice:

- perform a single major action, such as attacking, using a power or a skill, giving first aid to a dying person or attempting to flee.
- perform up to two minor actions, such as moving a short distance, standing up from prone, drinking a potion, switching weapons or using a minor power.

At the end of their turn, each player character makes a saving throw for each continuous effect that affects them. On success, the effect is canceled. At the end of each monster's turn, make a persistence roll for each continuous effect that affects them. 

## Melee attack
When a player character attacks a monster in melee, the player makes a Fortitude attack roll (d20 + Fortitude). If the result is greater than or equal to the Fortitude value of its target, the attack hits and the target loses a number hit points equal to the dice of the weapon used, plus the Fortitude of the character.	 

Example: Joe, a fighter with +7 Fortitude, attacks a goblin scout, whose Fortitude is 12. He rolls 9 on his attack roll, for a total of 16. The attack succeeds and Joe inflicts 1d8 + 7 points damage.

## Melee defense	 
When a monster attacks a character, the player makes a Fortitude defense roll (d20 + Fortitude). If the result is greater than or equal to the Fortitude value of the monster, the attack misses. If the defense roll fails, the attack hits and the monster deals its damage.

Example: it is now the goblin's turn, who Joe attacks. The player rolls 2 on his defense roll, for a total of 2 + 7 = 9. It is less than the 12 of the goblin, attack succeeds. Joe takes 9 damage.	

## Ranged attack and defense	 
A ranged attack works the same as that in melee, except that Fortitude is replaced by Reflex. And the attacker doesn't have to be next to his target, of course.

## Powers

Class or racial powers follow the same general principles, although often opposing different abilities. See the Powers chapter for more explanation.

## Critical hits and fumbles in combat

When a player gets a critical success on an attack roll or a critical failure on a defense roll, the attack deals double damage in addition to the regular effects.

## Fleeing

To flee, a character must succeed on a Reflex + Athletics check against the Reflex values of nearby enemies. If successful, they leave the battlefield like a coward. In case of failure, the character's enemies follow them; the character only moved away from their allies!

## Special maneuvers and attacks

During a combat, the players will sometimes have ideas for actions that do not correspond to a simple attack. They are generally of three types:

- the purpose of a maneuver is to offer a strategic advantage to the player character, without necessarily opposing an opponent. They are resolved by a skill check, against a difficulty chosen by the GM. 

  Here are a few examples: hiding in the shadows (Trickery), climbing on the back of a giant monster (Athletics; gives a +2 bonus on subsequent attacks), remembering a legend about a monster's weaknesses (Scholarship), etc. 
- protecting oneself behind a shelter (tree, overturned table, statue, etc.) is a maneuver that does not require a roll. It grants a +1 to +4 bonus to defense rolls, depending on the size of the shelter, but inflicts the same penalty on attack rolls.
- a special attack has a purpose other than injuring an opponent. They are resolved by an opposing roll, the characteristics of which are chosen by the GM. 

  Here are a few examples: pushing a monster into a hole (Fortitude vs. Fortitude), ducking an attack (Reflex vs. Reflex), bluffing to make a monster do something stupid (Will vs. Will), etc. A special attack never deals damage.

## Hit point management

If a character falls to 0 hit points or below, they are dying and can no longer act or defend themselves. They must succeed on a saving throw each turn to stay alive.

An ally can stabilize a dying ally by applying first aid. No skill check is necessary, success is automatic. It is enough to be next to the dying person and to spend a major action. Once healed, the character is no longer in danger of dying, but remains unconscious until the end of the combat.

If a monster drops to 0 hit points, it is either dead or stunned, at the choice of the player of the character who just attacked it.

## Rest

A few minutes' rest after a combat allows you to regain the use of your limited powers, and to spend Fate points to recover unique powers.

During a rest, the character can also spend a Fate point to recover 10 + Fortitude lost hit points. The presence of a cleric or warmaster on the team doubles this amount.

## End of adventure

After an adventure, the characters rest for a longer period of time, at least a week, in a safe and comfortable environment. This allows them to regain all of their HP, unique powers, and Fate points.

# Powers 

Powers represent the special abilities of races and classes.

## Presentation

Powers are presented as follows:

**Title:** The name of the power

**(Frequency)**

- At-will: This power can be used at will. It is always available.
- Limited: When used, this power is expended. It can be recharged during combat by spending a Fate point, or for free by resting for a few minutes after combat.
- Unique: When used, this power is expended. It can be recharged during a rest by spending a Fate point, or for free at the end of the adventure. 

**Action**

- Minor action: Using this power does not count as an attack. A character can perform a basic attack or use another power in the same turn.
- Reaction: A reaction modifies or adds to another action. It can be used even outside of the character's turn, as long as the conditions are met. It does not count as an action by itself.

If nothing is indicated, the power requires a major action.

**Scope**

- Contact: This power requires you to physically touch the target, sometimes with a melee weapon. 
- Distant: This power works within sight of the character. An invisible target is invalid.
- Distant burst: This power is shaped like a spherical explosion; it can affect up to five targets close together, all within the character's field of view. The Game Master must adjudicate in difficult cases.
- Contact burst: This power affects all visible targets within melee reach of the character.

If nothing is indicated, the power is personal; it only affects the character who uses it.

**Vs.**

The abilities to oppose when using this power.

If nothing is indicated, the power is automatic, it works without having to roll the dice.

**Success:** The effect of the power if the roll is successful; most of the time the amount of damage it inflicts on the target.

**Miss:** The effect of the power if the roll fails.

**Effect:** The effect of the power regardless of whether the attack/defense roll is successful or unsuccessful. 

Burst attacks still describe “the target” in the singular. The effects of a burst attack apply individually to each target hit, regardless of how many there are.

## Basic powers

Weapon attacks can be written as powers:

*Basic melee attack* (at-will). Contact. Fortitude vs. Fortitude. Effect: Weapon damage.

*Basic ranged attack* (at-will). Distant. Reflex vs. Reflex. Effect: Weapon damage.

*Shove* (at-will). Contact. Reflex vs. Fortitude. Success: Weapon damage, and the target falls prone. (Getting up from prone takes a minor action.)

*Charge* (at-will). Distant. Fortitude vs. Reflex. Success: Melee weapon damage +2. Effect: You are now in contact with the target.

*Feint* (at-will). Contact. Reflex Against Will. Success: Weapon damage, and the next attack roll against that target gains a +2 bonus.

*Wrestle* (at-will). Contact. Fortitude vs. Fortitude. Success: Unarmed damage, and the target is grabbed until your next turn. (You and the grabbed creature can no longer move and take a –2 penalty when defending against other combatants. The target can only attack you, and vice versa.)

# Rituals

Rituals are utilitarian magic formulas that are used outside of combat.

## Learning rituals

A wizard automatically gains a universal or arcane ritual at every even level. Other classes can learn universal or domain-specific rituals, at the same cost as for a skill.

It is also possible to receive a ritual formula as a reward or in a treasure, to be taught by a master or to invent one's own rituals. The latter option requires expensive magical research and magical ingredients, with details at the discretion of the Game Master.

You cannot learn a ritual of a higher level than your own.

## Performing a ritual

Performing a ritual takes several minutes, and requires complete concentration. It is therefore impossible during combat.

In addition, a ritual requires instruments and components, sometimes rare or expensive ones. Higher level rituals may require assistants, or even significant sacrifices.

Once the ritual is performed, its effects are usually instantaneous or last for a day. Details are at the discretion of the Game Master.

## Universal rituals

## Primal rituals

*Eagle form* (level 15). Transforms the caster into an eagle. They gain the Trickery skill, a +2 bonus to Reflex and a dive attack dealing 1d6 damage, but can no longer use any weapons or powers. And of course, they can fly.

# Bestiary	 

Here is a bestiary presenting a good number of creatures representative of medieval fantasy. 

## Combat balance	 
In general, a fight will be balanced if the player characters face a group of monsters of the same number and level as themselves. For example, four level 1 characters could face four giant spiders (monsters of level 1) without too much difficulty.

If the monsters are more numerous or higher level, the fight becomes more dangerous. Alternatively, if they are fewer or low level, the combat is less perilous.

## Minions
For more awesome, but no more dangerous, battles the GM can transform monsters into minions. Minions only have one hit point and deal half the damage of a normal monster, but are four times as numerous. Their abilities and at-will powers do not change but minions never have limited or unique powers.

For example, goblin minions have 1 HP (instead of 22), deal 4 damage (instead of 9) and roam in groups of 16 rather than 4.	 

## Elite	 
An elite monster is the opposite of a minion. It has more health and is more dangerous than other monsters of its type, ideal for climactic fight. 

To create an elite, take a normal monster (usually one or two levels higher than the PCs) and double its HP, without changing its abilities or powers. An elite monster receives a Darkness point at the start of each of its turns. (This point will disappear if it is not used during round. It is not added to the GM's shared pool of Darkness points.) Additionally, an elite monster can perform an additional free attack each turn.
