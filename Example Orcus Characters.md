# Gir, the Sacred Clown

Gir's people, the Massifi, live in the mountain spine of the Outlaw Kingdoms. Answering to no master, they fiercely protect their independence and the ancient privilege that allows the Massifi to travel the Kingdoms unaccosted and untaxed. Gir was inducted into the sacred clowning tradition as a young child, but has left his clan so he can return once he understands more of the outside world.

Finally, while she and her co-religionists were sacking a temple to Korven, she came upon an old priest whose quiet strength convinced her of the error of her ways.

# Prince Glim, the Deposed Prince

Glim was, not so long ago, the prince of the fair Kingdom of Brightstar in the foothills of the Brisingtham Mountains. An indifferent heir, he spent a little too freely on magic lessons using the royal treasury and found himself disinherited in favor of his wicked cousin. Within hours of his father's death he was outrunning the hounds over the border to Brightstar's neighbor Talgrad. Now he wanders the Outlaw Kingdoms with vague hopes of raising an army to claim his "rightful" throne.
