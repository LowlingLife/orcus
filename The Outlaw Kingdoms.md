# The Outlaw Kingdoms  

On the outskirts of the Empire hang the hundred and eight Outlaw Kingdoms, a motley collection of clans, city-states, marks, principalities, vassaldoms and - yes - even a few kingdoms. The formidable mountains and deep river valleys frustrate invaders, giving the people here a hard-won independence - but the Empire casts a long shadow.

# Creating an Outlaw Kingdoms character  

Although the Outlaw Kingdoms are there to make your own, the default assumptions are that heroes from this setting:   

* Have ability scores from the Point Buy or Standard Array methods.  
* Have a kit or feats, but not both.   
* Choose their ancestry as described below.   
  
# Ancestries  

Not all heroes in the Outlaw Kingdoms are human, but the differences between species matter less than the background that a hero comes from and the moment that marked them for greatness. As such, instead of having one ancestry like characters in other settings, characters have two halves to their ancestry: a background and a sign.   

If the two halves of your ancestry give a bonus to the same ability or same skill, choose any other ability or skill for the second bonus. For example, both the Seafarer background and the Escaped crux give a +2 bonus to Dexterity. Instead of a +4 bonus to Dexterity, an Escaped Seafarer would get a +2 bonus to Dexterity and a +2 bonus to any other ability score.

# Deities  

Crusaders are usually sworn to the service of a particular god. A sample of gods of worshipped in the Outlaw Kingdoms is given below.   

## Chalavar  

The Glutton  
 **Symbol:** A knife on an empty plate  
 **Portfolio:** Food, feasting, prosperity  
 **Favored Weapon:** Dagger  

A happy and boastful god, Chalavar (CHAL-uh-var) is a welcome visitor to any meal or business gathering, as he makes the food safe and incredibly tasty and the dealings profitable for all involved. Worshipped by people who work with food or conduct trade, Chalavar is a popular deity despite having few actual clerics. He is shown as a round, pleasant-faced man wearing expensive rings, necklaces, and a jeweled cylindrical hat. He knows the best use for any animal, from the work it is suited for to the other food it complements.  

He also knows the medicinal and culinary use for every plant. His rare temples are popular among adventurers, as Chalavar’s clerics love examining the carcasses of strange monsters to see what good can be made of them— for they study the art of cooking with as much ardor as their god.  

Chalavar’s worshippers have many holidays, including the birthdays of famous clerics or local nobles, seasonal occurrences, and historical events. These holidays always involve feasting.Worshippers even throw feasts on the holy days of other faiths, knowing that Chalavar gets his thanks whenever someone enjoys a good meal. It is considered bad form to not throw a feast on your own birthday, and wealthier followers of Chalavar show off their prosperity and generosity by holding great birth-feasts with hundreds of guests. Common folk praise Chalavar’s name whenever a meal is extra good or a business deal turns out particularly well.  

## Enoran  

The Old Spirit  
 **Symbol:** Sun setting behind a leafless tree  
 **Portfolio:** Death, the ending of things, mourning  
 **Favored Weapon:** Quarterstaff  

Enoran (EN-or-an) is a god spoken of only rarely, for he represents death from age, as well as the aging and decay of the world over time. He also comforts those who have suffered loss, whether the loss of a family member or the death of a treasured tree. A minor aspect of his faith involves the enactment of vengeance, although he has emphasized this less and less over the centuries.  

He is a sad, quiet deity, weary from carrying on his shoulders the weight of generations of sorrow and death. He is depicted as an impossibly old elf with gray hair and a wrinkled face. Enoran is said to keep a book of names of all the dead, written in his own blood.  

Enoran’s faith has no true holidays, though worshippers sing songs of joy every time someone comes back from the dead. Each day they light black candles in the name of those who died on that day. They fast for the last three days of the year, breaking their fast on the first sunrise of the new year.  

Even devout worshippers rarely speak of Enoran except at funerals and in the wake of battles.  

## Korven  

The Defending Blade  
 **Symbol:** A well-notched short sword  
 **Portfolio:** Defensive tactics, protection, vigilance, Halfling soldiers  
 **Favored Weapon:** Short sword  

A serious-minded deity, Korven (KOR-ven) protects all common folk and inspires them to defend their homes and families when beset by hostile creatures. He and his followers take a more reactive than proactive stance; if people are not threatened, he seems content to remain quiet and fortify, but when people are in danger he is ready to lead them to victory. His followers study traps and fortifications as well as applications of direct force. Under their tutelage even a simple caravan wagon can become a mobile fortress.  

He is rarely depicted, but when he is it is always as a fully-mailed halfling warrior with a battered short sword and metal shield, eyes showing determination from within an open-faced helmet.  

Korven is actually the fourth deity to hold this office. As each fell, their most faithful follower was deified. The cycle of death and renewal gives its current holder an acceptance of death and a tendency toward martyrdom, as he knows his legacy and duties will carry on.  

Korven’s followers celebrate (in somber fashion) the anniversaries of great battles where good people emerged victorious, and they light candles for heroes lost in battle while defending others. Lay people pray to him for protection at the start of a journey and before retiring for the evening, asking for safe travel and safe rest.  

## Larhoon  

The Bloodhunger  
 **Symbol:** Bloody-topped skull  
 **Portfolio:** Killing, murder  
 **Favored Weapon:** Club  

Larhoon (lar-HOON) is an unrelenting, violent deity, said to have sprung from the corpse of the just-murdered god of death, bristling with teeth and horns. He loves death in all its forms, from slow torture to quick disintegration. It is said that Larhoon never sleeps, that he will never rest as long as one creature still remains alive. Larhoon is no fan of the undead, either, and relishes destroying them nearly as much as he does living creatures. He is depicted as a gray-skinned muscular humanoid creature with spines and horns protruding in all places; his only raiment is a belt made of bloody skulls.  

Larhoon spends much of his time alone, searching for new things to kill. He welcomes challenges to his power and has drunk the blood of many godlings and great heroes who thought to slay him.  

Larhoon’s followers celebrate whenever there is a public death (such as an execution), feast on the anniversaries of battles in which many fell, and sacrifice animals to honor the names of famous assassins, murderers, and warlords. His faith consists of many small cults with no central hierarchy. Larhoon’s name has become a curse among the common folk. In less-than-orderly places, criminals are sacrificed to him in hopes of keeping his attention away from others in the community.  

## Kurzana  

The Builder  
 **Symbol:** Carpenter’s hammer with a spider symbol  
 **Portfolio:** Construction, building, weaving, engineering  
 **Favored Weapon:** Hammer  

Kurzana (kur-ZAH-nuh) is an old deity that has changed over time as the people of the world developed their knowledge of building. Originally a goddess of caverns, she took on the mantle of shelters when intelligent creatures began building homes for themselves, and eventually reached her current state, watching over all kinds of building, whether homes, temples, or other structures in a community. She opposes deities of destruction and those that dislike or harm civilization (such as gods of plague). She is depicted as a woman with stony skin, wearing a simple gown and bearing a hammer with a spider on it. Her faith considers killing normal spiders, her chosen animal, bad luck; monstrous spiders that actually constitute a threat are an exception. All building styles intrigue her, and she allies with likeminded deities. Although willing to talk endlessly about engineering, Kurzana remains otherwise a distant deity, having no close friendships with deities who do not share her specialized interests.  

Kurzana’s followers have few holidays, although they do note the dates on which the construction of great buildings began or ended. Although not a particularly martial faith, her clerics often move to small communities to establish temples that double as sturdy fortresses, which they open to the entire community when the settlement is threatened. Her clerics tend to be scholars in one building style, and sensible folk consult with a member of the church before planning any construction expected to last more than a year. Common folk pray to Kurzana during storms to keep their homes safe and at the groundbreaking of new buildings to bless those within.  

## Kain  

The Black Lord  
 **Symbol:** Horizontal mailed fist  
 **Portfolio:** Tyranny, rulership  
 **Favored Weapon:** Spear  

Kain (KAYN) is a megalomaniacal deity who believes that only the strong are fit to rule, and that he is destined to rule the world and all of the other gods. He makes elaborate plans and spends years watching them unfold, becoming frustrated when the actions of chaotic beings and other meddlers interfere with his plots. His brother is Vogg, a deity of random destruction and one of his frequent opponents, although the two cannot perceive each other directly or be affected by each others’ direct actions. While he hates the forces of good that interfere with his works, he saves his greatest wrath for chaotic fiends, who give no regard to his orders and (in his words) “give evil a bad name.” He is shown as a man with midnight-black skin and glowing eyes, wearing a noble’s clothing of simple cut and dark colors. His left arm is encased in black metallic armor, from which he can pull an iron spear as often as he likes.  

Kain’s church celebrates the anniversaries of great clerics’ and tyrants’ birthdays, the first day of every month, and every new moon. These celebrations are more an affirmation of faith in and loyalty to the Black Lord than episodes of revelry. The sacrifice of dissidents or enemies of the church accompanies the rites whenever possible. Few common folk worship Kain, although in places where he holds much political power he is respected for his ability to keep bandits and raiding monsters away. His rule is otherwise harsh.  

## Luna  

 **Symbol:** Three crescent moons arranged in a line  
 **Portfolio:** The moon, feminine power, non-evil lycanthropes  
 **Favored Weapon:** Chakram  

A very old goddess, Luna predates current civilizations. A powerful force for the protection and power of women, her strength has waxed and waned over the centuries. Where the sun is hot and aggressive in its light, the moon remains cool and gentle. She prefers peace to war, and kind words to loud speech, but when someone threatens her charges, she can tear apart her foes with the ferocity of a she-bear defending her cubs. She is also the patron goddess of lycanthropes, and her faith teaches that her light blesses good lycanthropes. Conversely, Luna teaches that evil lycanthropes are corruptions of her gifts to mortals; her followers hunt them down to either cure or kill. She is always shown as a woman with white eyes, dark hair, and a crescent symbol on her forehead, although other details vary. Dogs, wolves, and owls are her sacred animals.  

Luna’s church holds a small ceremony on the first day of each new, full, and quarter moon. Lunar eclipses always call for prayer vigils until the moon appears again, while solar eclipses are sacred events to be celebrated publicly, enjoying the night during the day. Women hold most positions of power in her church, and a disproportionate number of her clerics are female, but her church neither shuns nor marginalizes men. Common folk invoke Luna’s name at weddings to bless the bride and keep her safe in her husband’s house, at childbirth to guard the expectant mother’s health, and at any time when journeys must be made at night.  

## Shehaan  

Goddess of the Mists, the Mist Goddess  
 **Symbol:** A moon (crescent or full) behind a cloud of mist  
 **Portfolio:** Mist, isolation, concealment  
 **Favored Weapon:** Quarterstaff  

Shehaan (shay-HON) is a reclusive goddess, almost forgotten. Although this should mean her power is dwindling, she draws strength from her great solitude and uses it to protect her faithful. She avoids direct confrontation, preferring to redirect an opponent’s attention, confuse the minds of her enemies, and retreat when victory is not certain. She is shown as an elven woman with wet hair and pale skin, dressed in a gossamer robe or a concealing cloak.  

Like the moon, Shehaan changes. On nights when the moon is new she becomes rather wild, willing to take risks and even reveal her presence when she normally would remain hidden. This change does not affect the abilities of her worshippers, although they, too, seem more willing to take risks on these days.  

Solar eclipses are holy days to the faithful, when her followers given up to the goddess unusual plants and fruits as sacrifices. They go into hiding whenever a lunar eclipse occurs; during these times, which they call the “Night of Madness,” they lose all spellcasting ability, as their goddess goes truly mad and forgets her worshippers entirely. Shehaan always regrets these lapses and apologetically pays closer attention to her followers in the weeks following such an event.  

Where she is worshipped, the common folk pray to her to keep them hidden from the eyes of their enemies and to bring needed rain.  

## Thalander  

Quickheart, Many-Father  
 **Symbol:** White cat surrounded by a red glow  
 **Portfolio:** Vitality, fertility, strength  
 **Favored Weapon:** Longsword  

The boisterous and extroverted Thalander (tha-LANder) embodies the principles of life, survival, and perpetuation of life. Where he walks, plants sprout and animals spring up out of nothing. When he laughs, the air is filled with beautiful birds and insects. Thalander, the greatest foe of the undead, is often depicted blasting them out of existence with great beams of life energy from his hands. Like the cat of his symbol, Thalander has a roving eye and woos many people, whether deity, celestial, or mortal. He has many offspring, some of whom carry his divine blood more strongly than others. Thalander himself is a fair-skinned, redheaded man with a lean but strong build; he is usually shown barefoot, wearing cloth breeches and little else. In some of the more decadent cities his temples double as palaces devoted to the flesh, for his faith teaches that passion and childbirth are needed to remain vital and alive.  

The spring equinox is a day of great celebration, marking the height of Thalander’s power, and worshippers hold weekly feasts throughout the entire spring season. The autumn equinox is their only somber holiday, a remembrance of people met and lives shared in the past growing season, ending on a high note as they look forward to the breaking of winter. Common folk pray to Thalander to bring healthy crops and bless marriages with an abundance of children. They invoke his name at the presentation of a new child to the community, in hopes of ensuring a long and healthy life.  

## Thoin  

The Keeper, the Silent Pick  
 **Symbol:** A gem within a mountain  
 **Portfolio:** Mines, secrets under the earth  
 **Favored Weapon:** Pick  

Thoin (THOH-in) the Keeper is a silent deity of the rewards waiting underground. Not content to dig and sift for treasures, Thoin feels that his followers have a birthright to the Underdeep that authorises them to eliminate all heretics underground so their lesser hands will not profane the treasures with unskilled workmanship. Thoin’s particular hatred is for metal- and gem-eating monsters such as rust monsters, xorn, and metal-addicted delvers.  

Thoin is shown as a long-bearded dwarf made of stone, bearing a great pick or pickaxe, eyes and mouth glowing like sparkling gems or fresh lava. He never speaks, but seems amenable to the company of other earth deities who respect his dogma. His faithful take particular vengeance against thieves, burning them to death with molten rock.  

Followers of Thoin celebrate upon finding a vein of new ore, especially if that ore is mithral or adamantine. They hold weeklong wakes whenever a king or high priest dies and his followers never bury their dead with treasures—they see that as a waste of good metal and an affront to the deceased, as it presumes them incapable of looking for new treasures in the afterlife. Thoin’s churches display their wealth openly as a display of the god’s power and generosity. A temple of Thoin doubles as an armory and fortress, as followers use it as a launching point for attacks on pagan miners and for defense against raiders. Common people pray to Thoin after hard work to find rewards and before battles waged to gain or protect valuable objects.  

## Vaath  

The Laugher  
 **Symbol:** A laughing mouth within a wavy circle  
 **Portfolio:** Humor, irony  
 **Favored Weapon:** Rapier  

Vaath (VOTH) is a well-traveled deity, always on the run from her last escapade. She represents the ability to laugh at frightening or impossible situations as well as the more traditional aspects of humor and irony. She dislikes older, staid deities, preferring to shake things up a bit and see what laughter there is to discover in the world. Depictions of her vary, but she is usually shown as a humanoid woman with a large grin and bright teeth (although she is sometimes shown as a fox or even a man). She trained herself to run faster than the wind, hold her breath for nine days, and speak out of both sides of her mouth; three skills she needed to pull off an elaborate joke on the gods of storms, fire, and cities. She loves recruiting worshippers from serious or wrathful deities just to see the reaction of her divine opponents.  

Vaath’s worshippers pray on a different schedule from month to month, chosen by the deity and revealed at the last minute. Her followers are great fans of All Fool’s Day, where they make up almost unbelievable stories and try to get as many people as possible to fall for them. They honor the birthdays of local nobles with roasts and caricatures, and often celebrate somber holidays of other faiths with loud songs, indecent jokes, and extravagant pranks. Because of these habits, many priests of Vaath use aliases when going about the goddess’ work or use disguises or magic to pretend to worship other deities in order to prevent retaliation. Common people invoke her name in times of good cheer and when things go wrong, in hopes of seeing a more positive side—such as the church’s fable of the plowman’s ox that hurt its leg on a stone, under which lay a nugget of gold.  

## Valkon  

The Sky Lord  
 **Symbol:** Cloud with a lightning bolt  
 **Portfolio:** Air, wind, clouds, ordered nature of the heavens  
 **Favored Weapon:** Longbow  

Valkon (VAL-kahn) is the master of the air and heavens, from the stars to coastal breezes and everything in between. An active and aggressive deity, he loathes chaos, unpredictability, and ancient magical weapons of war that promote those things. This puts him at odds with most other weather deities, who tend to be more carefree and capricious. His celestial messengers are birds, and his temples often use birds to carry messages or spy on their enemies. Valkon enjoys archery and believes it to be a superior form of warcraft to melee fighting. In artwork he is depicted as a tall winged man, lithe but strong, bearing a longbow and having close-cropped fair hair.  

Valkon’s worshippers celebrate the equinoxes and solstices as holy days, as well as the first rainfall in spring and the first snowfall in autumn or winter. Common folk pray to him to bring needed rains or fend off approaching storms, which are always considered to be the work of rival weather gods.  

## Vogg  

The Firelord  
 **Symbol:** An eye surrounded by flame  
 **Portfolio:** Wildfire, destruction, randomness  
 **Favored Weapon:** Mace  

Vogg (VOG) is the embodiment of random destruction. Although he is as intelligent as his brother Kain, he only uses his mind to think up ways to break things faster, louder, and hotter. He is more than content to run about covered in flames of his own creation, setting afire anything he touches or even gazes at for too long.  

He is shown as a humanoid (the type varies by artist and cult) with his skin blackened by great heat, hair of flame, and carrying a mace made of solid fire. Vogg doesn’t really hate anything as much as he is curious about how well and how quickly he can destroy it. He becomes angry when someone places in his way obstacles that he cannot harm, and he becomes livid when someone quenches a fire he sets or dares to try calming him. Vogg would be a more powerful deity if he didn’t have the habit of answering some invocations with blasts of violent fire, which tends to reduce his number of worshippers. He is a friend to fire elementals and tolerates efreet and other fiery creatures.  

Vogg’s worshippers care little for scheduled holidays, but revel in the presence of any great fire, whether naturally occurring or deliberately set. They’re not above setting a fire for the excuse to celebrate. Though most of his followers are too simpleminded to appreciate the destruction of particularly valuable things (such as sacred groves, historic buildings, and so on), they do like watching temples to protective or water deities burn to ash. On the hottest day of the year, members of the church summon as many fire elementals as possible and send them running about, burning whatever they see. In idle times, cult cells are likely to self-destruct, as rival clerics set each other on fire as fanatical offerings to their obsessive deity.  

## Yaheine  

The Sword Maiden  
 **Symbol:** Kite shield with a sunburst  
 **Portfolio:** Protection, valor, honor  
 **Favored Weapon:** Bastard sword  

Daughter of the sun god, Yaheine (ya-HEEN) is the faithful guardian, protector of the innocent, and champion of good. Channeling the power of her father, Yaheine strikes out at all evil in her path, making places safe for decent folk. She cannot abide fiends or the undead, and hunts necromancers and demonologists without mercy. She is shown as a tall woman bearing a flashing bastard sword and clad in shining metal armor, her gold hair unbound in a storm about her face like solar flames. When age catches up with her clerics and paladins, they usually take up a leadership role in a community, administering fair law and keeping the peace, ready to bear arms whenever evil raises its head. Her followers respect those who worship the sun god, and the two closely allied churches often share space in the same temple.  

Yaheine’s clerics and paladins pray for their spells at dawn when the leading edge of the sun first becomes visible. Their holy days are the summer solstice and midwinter— said to be the time of year when the sun god’s clerics received word that his daughter had been born and would become a champion for all good in the world. Common folk pray to her for fairness in all things, as well as protection in unsafe places. Her name is used to seal oaths as a promise of good intent.
