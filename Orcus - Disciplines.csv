Blades in the Dark,Dexterity,Strength,Martial,"Many of these powers use momentum. Other than these powers, the main way to gain momentum are the features of the Swashbuckler class. You are welcome to take these powers without belonging to the Swashbuckler class, but if they involve momentum they may be of limited use to you. 

If you do gain momentum from a power, the same rule for losing momentum applies as for the Swashbuckler: you lose it if you are hit by any attack. "

Elemental Flux,Intelligence,Constitution,Arcane,"When you first gain a power with the Flux tag, choose an element: lightning, acid, cold, fire or thunder. All powers with the Flux keyword have that energy as a keyword, and replace any reference to [flux] in the power text with that energy. There are some powers that allow you to change your Flux energy, if you take them. You can also change your Flux energy when you retrain at a new level. Some classes interact with Flux powers in other ways. 

When a power refers to [flux], it always means your current flux energy, even if you used the power when your flux energy was different. For example, if you conjured a vortex devil, it does damage of your current flux energy not the flux energy you had when you conjured it. "
